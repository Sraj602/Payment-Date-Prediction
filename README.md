# Highradius_project
#### the project is about a predication to the date of payment by the customers in the highradius company
In this project, I've been working on using machine learning to predict when customers will pay their invoices. I've gone through several steps like cleaning up the data, exploring it to find patterns, creating new useful features, and picking out the best ones. After training my model, I found that it's about 70% accurate in predicting when payments will be late and when they'll come in on time.
